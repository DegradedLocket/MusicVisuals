# Music Visualiser Project

Name: Conor Melia

Student Number: C18312261

## Instructions
- Fork this repository and use it a starter project for your assignment
- Create a new package named your student number and put all your code in this package.
- You should start by creating a subclass of ie.tudublin.Visual
- There is an example visualiser called MyVisual in the example package
- Check out the WaveForm and AudioBandsVisual for examples of how to call the Processing functions from other classes that are not subclasses of PApplet

# Description of the assignment

# Instructions
For the Circle Visualiser, initially there is only a single circle. In order to 
add more circles to the visualiser the 'n' key is pressed.

# How it works
When creating these visuals I used the example as a guideline for developing mine.
I have visuals called in two different ways, CubeVisual and CircleVis are called 
and created directly in the Main method. Circles on the other hand is called in the MyVisualiser class which creates objects for this visuals.

Cube Visual is a basic visualier that has both rotation and laterally. The amplitude dictates both the size and the distance from the centre.

Circle Vis starts with a single circle of a radius that is based on the amplitude. More circles can be added by the user. These radii of these circles are also based on amplitided but the amplitude is multiplied for each iteration.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
